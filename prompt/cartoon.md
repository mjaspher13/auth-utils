Create a personalized character profile for me based on my role, personality, and the way I collaborate with others.
The output should include:

A unique character name (not generic).

A persona backstory tied to my real work style and strengths.

A short, memorable catchphrase that reflects how I usually help or communicate.

A visual character description that captures my real appearance traits (hair color, glasses, hairstyle, etc.) without assuming details.

A visual-portrait prompt that I can feed into an image generator (cartoon-style, avatar-style, or hero-style).

Use my role, interactions, and personality traits to make the character feel accurate rather than generic. Make the tone friendly, empowering, and fun
