🏯 Japanese Painting Hero Profile
✅ Hero Name:

電影の構師 (Denei no Kōshi)
“Architect of Lightning Shadows”

A poetic Japanese-style hero name blending electricity (電), elegance (影), and craftsmanship (構師).

✅ Persona & Backstory (Japanese Painting Version)

In a land where storms whisper ancient secrets, Denei no Kōshi emerged as a master of ordered lightning — a hero who shapes energy with the precision of a calligrapher guiding ink across silk.

Calm, observant, and deliberate, he possesses the rare ability to stabilize the world’s unseen currents. While others see chaos, he sees structure — pathways, patterns, and flows — the same way a traditional Japanese artisan perceives balance between brushstroke and empty space.

His presence radiates quiet strength. With a single gesture, he can align electrical forces like a Zen monk centering the spirit. Villages and cities alike call upon him when balance falters, for he brings order not through violence but through harmony.

「静けさの中にこそ、力は宿る。」
